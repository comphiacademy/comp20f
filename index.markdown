This course is an introduction to the branch of logic known as Computability Theory, which is used to be called Recursion Theory. It combines the abstract mathematical theory of computability with the concrete art of algorithm design with various types of automata. Topics include models of computations for languages and functions, the general computability theory, reducibility, incompleteness, time complexity, and advanced topics such as arithmetic hierarchy and induction. This course provides a solid foundation for further studies in mathematical logic, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and philosophy. 

The coronavirus pandemic will not stop us from meeting each other in the classroom. In case the situation gets worse, we will retreat to online meeting immediately.
