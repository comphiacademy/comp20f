11/26 Announcement: Up until now, we have covered the main contents of the computability theory. For the rest of the course, I will introduce one additional application and one generalization of the theory. Since you prefer the writing of the books, I eliminated all the materials I prepared that are not in the book. I will also refain from talking about any intuition or understanding outside of the book. I will also switch back and talk in English. If you prefer to read the book by yourself, or if you do not like English lectures, then you are free to not come to the class for the rest of the course. It won't affect your grade.    

This course is an introduction to the branch of logic known as Computability Theory, which is used to be called Recursion Theory. It combines the abstract mathematical theory of computability with the concrete art of algorithm design with various types of automata. Topics include models of computations for languages and functions, the general computability theory, reducibility, incompleteness, time complexity, and advanced topics such as arithmetic hierarchy and induction. This course provides a solid foundation for further studies in mathematical logic, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and philosophy. 

The coronavirus pandemic will not stop us from meeting each other in the classroom. In case the situation gets worse, we will retreat to online meeting immediately.
